![We must never forget what she represents](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8a527074-05db-484b-80a4-b057a9d6d56b.jpg)

On this 4th of July 2016 Lady Liberty's ideals are being tested like never before. But times are like never before. There are still people being forced from their homelands by tyranny and persecution. Sound familiar, like in the 1930's ?

History has a way of repeating itself and no one should turn a blind eye. Yet we cannot fall into a Trojan Horse trap of false security. 

We must be vigilant, yet caring.
