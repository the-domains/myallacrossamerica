  James Baldwin has been seen as a prophet, as a suspect, as the greatest
  American essayist in history. He was also a sharp examiner of the urban
  environment. He captured the rhythms of city life, the character and habits
  and various circumstances of their inhabitants, as well as he captured the
  broader character of cultures, populations, and institutions.
