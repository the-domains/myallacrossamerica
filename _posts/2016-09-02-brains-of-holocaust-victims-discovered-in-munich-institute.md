The horrors of the nazi regime in germany during the 30's and 40's still haunt humanity to this day as new evidence is unearthed. The United States Constitution as written by our forefathers, was penned in part and has been successful in preventing this type of crime against our citizens.

**It's in The "Second Amendment"**

The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." If you believe for a minute the armed citizens of our nation would not hesitate to rise up against such a threat, you would be truely mistakened.

So voters _**and**_ candidates alike. Think long and hard on what you hear or promise. For when you step into the voting booth this November you know those who stand by the Second Amendment will have your six." just saying...ricko ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
