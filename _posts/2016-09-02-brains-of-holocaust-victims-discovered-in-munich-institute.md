"The horrors of the nazi regime in germany during the 30's and 40's still haunt humanity to this day as new evidence is unearthed. The United States Constitution was designed inr part and has been successful in preventing this type of crime against our citizens.

Specifically the "Second Amendment. The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." If you believe for a minute the armed citizens of our nation would not hesitate to rise up against such a threat, you would be sure mistakened." ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ just saying...ricko
