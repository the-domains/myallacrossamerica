A man who worked for almost 50 years as a librarian at the University of New Hampshire left the school an astonishing $4 million after his death last year.

"A place of peace and quiet filled with millions of words and images you need to turn the pages to view. No copy and paste here. You need to look, read and absorb the knowledge. Exercise your brain a bit. Sadly I was not one of those students who appreciated all of what a library is about." just sayin...ricko

"A tip of the hat to Mr. Morin please. To him it obviously was a mission and a passion to be part of the learning process for the many students he saw during his tenure and now the students of the future due to his gracious gift." just sayin...ricko
