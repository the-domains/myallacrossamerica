That is the lesson Donald Trump is currently learning - and he is learning it the hard way. His frustration with the "dishonest media" shouldn't be surprising. After all, his rise from self-promoting, self-proclaimed billionaire to Republican presidential nominee was abetted by the same press that is now in the process of pouring cold water on him.</p></article>

Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq all hit new highs</h1><p>Stocks rallied and the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all hit new closing highs Thursday, bolstered by a strong earnings report from department store Macy's, fresh data showing the labor market remains solid and a rebound in oil prices.</p></article>

### Just another rosie picture of false sense of security...were you one of hundreds of thousands whose retirement plans went up in smoke at the hands of these experts as they failed to advise the average person their mutual funds likely would evaporate before you received your "next months account" statement ?

### I still love \#usa dearly but have grown weary of decades of being scammed into working until the day you die.
