The Democratic nominee was referencing Romney's remarks during a 2012 president debate about gender equality, when he said he'd reviewed "binders full of women" for positions in his administration as governor of Massachusetts.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1c855c517bc2050961fc00e600314545/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.cdn.turner.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F160802153821-donald-trump-and-ivanka-trump-large-tease.jpg"></article>]]></description>
